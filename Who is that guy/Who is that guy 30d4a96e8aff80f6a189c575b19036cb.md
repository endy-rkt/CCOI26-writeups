# Who is that guy?

**About:**

- OSINT challenge
- Level: Medium

**Subject:**
We found this guy, can you investigate a bit about him ? We just have his pseudo, good luck :) His pseudo is: d3dpanda

**Hypothesis:**

- does we need to know who is that guy like the title suggest ?
- is it like these challenge where some user write some flag on the discord?
- or does this user share something or the flag on some website?
- or something else?

1. who is this guy?

already heard this name somewhere  in the ocoi comunity but where?

- search in the new discord for cybercup first but none
- found him on the **Hack The Box Meetup: Ocean Indian**

so we know that the dude is a **staff** in the **ocoi cybercup** 

- test is name as flag but no
- stalk is linkedin and github  but nothing at all

all we know is that :

- some **staff** at ocoi cybercup
- the guy is maybe a **developer**

1. also for the second hypothesis there is  also no flag on the 2 discord and in is discord account 
2. does this user share something or the flag on some website?

so maybe it’s this osint challenge where we search something on the net that was shared by some user 

so when we say osint challenge always say **OSINT FRAMEWORK time**

from there we can search for username 

so we try **whatsMyName** like for the 2 first we need to install and

try these but nothing interesting also so try to be more precised with filter like we know the guy is a developer 

then we found this interesting account on replit
